# Traffic-Light-Control-System
Introduction: A traffic light control system is essential for managing road intersections efficiently. The system controls the traffic flow by switching between Red, Yellow, and Green lights. This project simulates a traffic light control system using Python on Google Colab and visualizes its transitions using a graphical representation.
